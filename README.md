# Bootstrap AngularJS, Node.js and MongoDB


## Description

This is a project skeleton to start quickly your project. It's composed of a nodejs backend server used to host a RESTful api using express and mongoose, and a frontend AngularJS application.


## Installation

Get the sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdelemme/bootstrap-angular-node-mongo.git
```

### NodeJS

In order to start the nodejs server, we need express and mongoose dependencies.

In the api directory, install the nodejs dependencies:
```bash
kevin@home:api$ npm install
```

### AngularJS

Use Gulp to build your JavaScript sources:
```bash
kevin@home$ gulp
```

You should see:
```bash
kevin@home$ gulp
[gulp] Using gulpfile gulpfile.js
[gulp] Starting 'scripts'...
[gulp] Finished 'scripts' after 18 ms
[gulp] Starting 'default'...
[gulp] Finished 'default' after 10 Î¼s
```

## Usage

### Server

Starts the nodejs application:
```bash
node api/app.js
```

You should see:
```bash
kevin@home:/var/www/angular/template$ node api/app.js 
[INFO] Your project API started on port 3000
[DB] Successfully connected to: mongodb://localhost/template
```

### Client

Open your browser on `http://localhost/template/app`
